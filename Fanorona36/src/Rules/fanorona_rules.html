<p><font face="Arial" size="3"> 
Fanorona is a board game for two players. It is played with black and
white pieces placed on a board. The board is a rectangular grid of nine
lines by five, with some diagonal lines marked.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">
The picture shows the board at the start of the game. The two players
each have 22 pieces of their colour on the board. The pieces are placed
where the gridlines cross, as shown.</font></p>

<table align="center">
<tbody><tr><td align="center" bgcolor="#ffffff"><img src="fanor02.gif"></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><font face="Arial" size="3">Ready to Start!</font></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">
One player has the black pieces and the other has white. White moves
first, then Black, and so on with the players taking turns. To win the
game, you have to <b><i>take all</i></b> your opponent's pieces, or to leave a position where they <b><i>can't move</i></b>. If neither player manages to win, then the game is a draw.</font></p>

<hr>

<table align="center"><tbody><tr>
<td align="center"><font face="Arial" size="4"><b><a name="capture">Capturing</a></b></font></td></tr></tbody></table>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3"> A piece moves <b><i>one space only</i></b>
along the lines of the board, either straight or diagonally. Pieces can
only move onto empty spaces, they cannot land on top of another piece.
And you can only make diagonal moves along the diagonal lines shown on
the board.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3"> Whenever you make a move, you <b><i>must</i></b> make a capturing move if you can. You capture a single piece or line of pieces by moving directly <b><i>towards</i></b> them, so that your piece ends up next to them. Or else by moving directly <b><i>away</i></b> from them, if your piece was already standing next to them.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Suppose
that you are White in this game. You can move your piece marked A in
the first picture below one space diagnonally forwards to the empty
place in the middle of the board. Then it has moved directly towards
the black pieces marked x and ended up next to them. So they are both
captured. </font></p><p><font face="Arial" size="3">You can capture any <b><i>unbroken</i></b> line of black pieces in this way. Because you captured these pieces by moving towards them, this is called capture by <b><i>approach</i></b>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The second picture below shows the position after you have made this move. It is now Black's turn.</font></p>

<table align="center" bgcolor="#ffffc0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="8">
<tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff"><img src="fanor03.gif"></td><td bgcolor="#ffffff"><img src="fanor06a.gif"></td></tr>
<tr><td align="center"><font face="Arial" size="3"> Before your first move</font></td><td align="center"><font face="Arial" size="3"> After your first move</font></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<table align="center"><tbody><tr>
<td align="center"><font face="Arial" size="4"><b><a name="relay">Relay Capturing</a></b></font></td></tr></tbody></table>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">When you make a capture, it is not necessarily the end of your turn. You are allowed to move the same piece <b><i>again</i></b> to capture more pieces. You can do this <b><i>several times</i></b> during the same turn, so long as you keep capturing each time you move the piece. We could call this a relay capture.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">
For example, in this game it is now Black's move. As we can see in the
picture on the left below, Black can move the piece marked A one space
up the board. This captures the three white pieces marked x by moving
away from them. This way of taking pieces is called capture by <b><i>withdrawal</i></b>. The second diagram shows the situation after this happens.</font></p>

<table align="center" bgcolor="#ffffc0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="8">
<tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff"><img src="fanor07.gif"></td><td bgcolor="#ffffff"><img src="fanor09.gif"></td></tr>
<tr><td align="center"><font face="Arial" size="3"> Before Black's first capture</font></td><td align="center"><font face="Arial" size="3"> After the capture</font></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">
But this is not necessarily the end of Black's move. Black can now
capture some more of your pieces! Look at the left-hand board in the
next picture. The same piece which has just moved is again marked A. It
can now move diagonally down to the left and capture the piece marked
y. The piece marked z will <b><i>not be captured</i></b> because of the <b><i>gap</i></b> between y and z.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The
right-hand board shows the situation after this happens. Black could
now make another capture in this same turn - can you see how?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Although Black could now capture more pieces, Black is allowed to <b><i>choose</i></b>
whether or not to do this. Although you always have to capture some
pieces on your turn if you can, you do not have to keep making more and
more captures on the same turn if you don't want to. You can choose to <b><i>stop</i></b> at some point instead of moving your piece again.</font></p>

<table align="center" bgcolor="#ffffc0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="8">
<tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff"><img src="fanor08.gif"></td><td bgcolor="#ffffff"><img src="fanor10.gif"></td></tr>

<table align="center"><tbody><tr>
<td align="center"><font face="Arial" size="4"><b><a name="restrict">Capturing Restrictions</a></b></font></td></tr></tbody></table>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">During
a capturing move, it may happen that you move a piece in a way that
could take some pieces by withdrawal or some others by approach. If
this happens, you <b><i>must choose</i></b> which of the two captures you want to take. You are <b><i>not allowed</i></b> to take them both.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">As
an example, we could go back to the opening position. Here you could
have started by moving the piece marked A one to the right. If you did
that you could choose which of the two pieces marked x to take off. But
you are not allowed to take them both.</font></p>

<table align="center">

</tbody></table>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">There are a few other rules about what happens during a relay capture. All the capturing must be done by the <b><i>same piece</i></b>. The piece must <b><i>change direction</i></b> each time it moves during the relay capture. And it must not stand on the <b><i>same spot</i></b> twice during this sequence.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">As
long as the piece changes direction at each stage during the move, it
is free to re-use one of the directions it has used earlier at a later
stage in the move.</font></p>

<table align="center"><tbody><tr>
<td align="center"><font face="Arial" size="4"><b><a name="paika">Paika Moves</a></b></font></td></tr></tbody></table>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">If you cannot make a capturing move, then you are allowed to make a non-capturing move. This is known as a <b><i>paika</i></b> move. To do this you <b><i>simply move</i></b> one piece along a line to an adjacent point.</font></p>

<p><<font face="Arial" size="3">For
example, let's go back to the game we were playing before. The left
hand board in the next diagram shows the position later on in the same
game. You now have four pieces and Black has only two, so you may have
a good chance to win!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Here
you can't make any capturing move, so you have to make a paika move.
Suppose you move your piece at the bottom of the board one space to the
right. This looks a bit odd, because Black is now forced to capture
this piece by withdrawal. After that, you will get to the situation
shown in the board on the right.</font></p>
<font face="Arial" size="3"> 
<table align="center" bgcolor="#ffffc0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="8">
<tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff"><img src="fanor14.gif"></td><td bgcolor="#ffffff"><img src="fanor13a.gif"></td></tr>
<tr><td align="center"><font face="Arial" size="3"> Before your paika move</font></td><td align="center"><font face="Arial" size="3"> After Black's capture</font></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

</font><p><font face="Arial" size="3">Your
move was not so silly after all, because now you can move your piece at
the top of the board straight down one space. Then the following move
you will definitely be able to make a capture. So Black will be down to
only one piece. See if you can work out what happens.</font></p>

<table align="center"><tbody><tr>
<td align="center"><font face="Arial" size="4"><b><a name="endgame">End of the Game</a></b></font></td></tr></tbody></table>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The
game ends when one player has no pieces left, or is unable to make a
move. Then they have lost. If neither player can force the other into
this situation, the game is a draw.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Look at the position below. This might be the end of the game we have been looking at.</font></p>

<table align="center">
<tbody><tr><td align="center" bgcolor="#ffffff"><img src="fanor12.gif"></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><font face="Arial" size="3">Game Over!</font></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">It is Black's move. But whatever move Black makes, you will capture the last black piece. The game is over!</font></p>
